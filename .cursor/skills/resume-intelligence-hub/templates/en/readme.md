# Resume & Career Hub

An AI-driven personal resume library and career-development hub.

## First time here? Start here

The core context file is **`AGENTS.md`** (the cross-IDE standard — Claude Code, Cursor, Codex, Cline, Windsurf, GitHub Copilot, and others all read it).

Pick your AI IDE:

- **Claude Code**: run `claude` in this directory — it auto-loads `AGENTS.md`. If you're on an older Claude Code that only reads `CLAUDE.md`, symlink: `ln -s AGENTS.md CLAUDE.md`
- **Cursor**: copy `AGENTS.md` content into `.cursor/rules/agents.mdc`, or symlink
- **Windsurf**: copy into `.windsurfrules` or symlink
- **GitHub Copilot**: copy into `.github/copilot-instructions.md`
- **Cline / Continue / Aider**: point the tool's rules file (`.clinerules` / `.continue/config.json` / `CONVENTIONS.md`) at `AGENTS.md`

**Get started** (works with any of the above):
1. `cd` into this repo from the terminal
2. Launch your AI IDE
3. Say things like "tailor my resume for this JD" or "prep me for this interview" — the agent guides the next steps
4. **Let the AI fill most of this for you**: don't hand-type the blank fields in `profiles/`. Just tell the agent the facts, and it structures them into the right files.

## Positioning

Targeting (fill at bootstrap — target seniority) roles in (industry / domain). See `AGENTS.md` for positioning details.

## Features

### Job applications
- **JD-tailored resume generation** — match and reassemble from the experience library to produce custom resumes for a specific role
- **Interview coaching** — simulated interviews, STAR story prep, technical/craft review based on the JD and generated resume
- **Career consulting** — gap analysis, path planning, market-trend insights
- **Personal branding** — cover letters, self-introduction scripts, LinkedIn summaries

<!-- Research track enabled -->

### Grant / research applications
- **Application profile generation** — format-compliant research CVs per grant type
- **Research-basis drafting** — auto-generate the "research basis" section from the research archive
- **Output filtering** — surface the most relevant publications/patents/standards/projects for each direction

<!-- End -->

### Verification & fact-checking
- **Supporting-materials index** — path references to local, cloud-synced, and public-URL evidence (sensitive originals stay out of Git)
- **Public-source cross-check** — verify load-bearing claims before high-stakes submissions

<!-- Credential / promotion dossier track enabled -->

### Credential / promotion dossiers
- **Rulebook decomposition** — turn eligibility, exceptional-track, and signature-achievement requirements into an evidence matrix
- **Missing-evidence management** — track appointment letters, reviews, continuing education, ownership proof, contracts/acceptance/revenue/users, standards/patents/awards
- **Risk-safe wording** — rewrite claims that cannot yet be publicly verified or supported by documents
