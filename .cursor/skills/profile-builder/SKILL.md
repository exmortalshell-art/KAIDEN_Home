description: Builds and updates the user's personal profile from raw CV or career materials. Use when the user shares CV/background context as files in raw_inputs/profile/ or directly in chat, and wants to update memory/personal_profile.md. Also use when the user wants to add a new experience, skill, or education entry to their profile.

# Profile Builder

## Project context
- Profile lives at `memory/personal_profile.md`
- Raw materials can come from files in `raw_inputs/profile/` (supported formats: pdf, txt, md) or directly from chat context.
- If `memory/personal_profile.md` does not exist yet, create it from scratch using the output format below.

## Workflow

1. If `@memory/personal_profile.md` exists, read it as the current state. If it does not exist yet, start from an empty profile.
2. Read the raw material the user provides (either via `@file` reference or pasted/summarized in chat).
3. Extract and structure the information — ask the user to clarify anything ambiguous.
4. Write the **complete updated** `memory/personal_profile.md`. Never delete existing content without asking.

## Output format for `personal_profile.md`

```markdown
# Personal Profile

## Contact Information

## Professional Summary

## Experiences
### [Job Title] — [Company] (YYYY – YYYY)
- 2-4 concise STAR-style bullets (high-level)
- Optional: **Project/Role Details** subsection with richer evidence:
  - Scope/ownership
  - Technical stack and methods
  - Safety/risk constraints handled
  - Quantitative outcomes, benchmarks, or business impact
  - Links/publications/artifacts (if available)

## Education

## Skills
```

## Rules
- Append and improve — never overwrite without reading first when a profile already exists.
- Use STAR-style summaries for each experience where possible.
- Keep both layers when useful: a skimmable top layer + a deeper evidence layer for downstream matching.
- Prioritise high-signal detail over excessive compression when information helps `application-advisor` map requirements to evidence.
- Never delete concrete evidence (metrics, tools, publications, safety work, leadership scope) unless the user asks.
- On first run, create a clean `personal_profile.md` that follows the output format exactly.
- After saving, confirm what was added or changed.
